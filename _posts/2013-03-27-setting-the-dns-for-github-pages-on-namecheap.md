After pushing my site to **GitHub** and verifying that it worked at [davidensinger.github.com](davidensinger.github.com), I then went to set up my custom domain name. The [documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages) provided by GitHub is clear on the subject, but I still managed to forget about my subdomains. For more than eight hours, anyone who attempted to visit [www.davidensinger.com](http://www.davidensinger.com) was served with a 404, which is [rather embarrassing](https://twitter.com/DavidEnsinger/status/316642135216619522) for one who makes a living as a developer.
