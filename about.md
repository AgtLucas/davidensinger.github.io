# About

<p class="text-intro">My name is <strong>David Ensinger</strong> and while I’m currently a <strong>Front End Developer</strong>, I don’t feel bound to the constraints of the job title. My skills and interests are varied and I’m happiest when I’m busy designing, developing, writing, or doing a combination thereof.</p>

The websites I develop are well designed, useable, and adhere to modern standards and accessibility requirements. I’m also no slouch at writing documentation, leading training, and providing ongoing support. My clients and co-workers will vouch that I’m amiable and play nice with others too.

I currently work at [The Ohio State University Libraries](http://library.osu.edu/), but in past lives I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Republic of Moldova and a Web Marketing & Technology Specialist at eSchool Consultants. I graduated from the Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business with a B.S. in Business Administration with a specialization in Finance.

My interests include all things Eastern European (whether it be language, food, or history), personal finance and investing (hence the degree), and staying physically fit and eating well. I also really enjoy living in Columbus, Ohio.
