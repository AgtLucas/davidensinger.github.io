# About

<p class="text-intro">My name is <strong>David Ensinger</strong> and I’m a <strong>Front End Developer</strong> with equal parts skill in design, development, and writing.</p>

I develop websites that are designed well, useable, and adhere to modern standards and accessibility requirements. I’m also no slouch at writing documentation, leading training, and providing ongoing support. My clients and co-workers will vouch that I play well with others too.

My current employer is [The Ohio State University Libraries](http://library.osu.edu/), but in past lives I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in the Republic of Moldova and a Web Marketing & Technology Specialist at eSchool Consultants. I graduated from the Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business with a B.S. in Business Administration with a specialization in Finance.

I am interested in the liberal arts, finance and investing, and staying physically fit and eating well. I also really enjoy living in Columbus, Ohio.

For my personal web presence, see the [Republic of the Spirit](http://www.republicofthespirit.com/).
